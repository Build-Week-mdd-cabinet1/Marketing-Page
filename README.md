# Marketing-Page

Marketing page: create a marketing page that will attract the userâ€™s attention and will make them most likely click on the sign-up button This should take the user to the sign up page. Also add three pharagraphs expaining the app. 
About me: Should include all the members who worked on it. 
The navigation should be able to take people to the about us page, the log-in page (assuming they already have an account with us), contact at the bottom of the website, and the home page.
There are mixins in the mixins.less file which affect the color of the background, the color of the navigation and its font. This will affect the footer and all the pages worked on with the naviagtion bar. The background color affects all pages that I created. 
There is also a .lb() which allows any developer to locate the border of whichever part of the project thay are working on. The border is 2px red solid. They can modify it on the Mixins page.
