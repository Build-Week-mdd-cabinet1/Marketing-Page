                    different strains and varieties. You could spend 
                    hours clicking through each strain, listing all 
                    the ones that help with your specific condition, 
                    only to realize that each one has a unique taste 
                    that you may prefer or dislike. This is where Dr.

                    strawberry that helps you relax and drift up off to sleep. 
                    Its up to you, and it is up to us to use our state-of-the

                <h3> Usefulness of Marijuana as a Medicine</h3>
                <p>Medical marijuana is a relatively new term. While people 
                    have known about it's medical qualities for thousands of 
                    years, in the last hundred years or so it has been deemed 
                    by governments as a drug with absolutely no positive or 
                    medical benefits. It is now coming back into common knowledge 
                    that medical marijuana can be used to change lives. It is remarkable 
                    as a medicine to treat nausea, insomnia, aches and pains, and its 
                    effects can even help relieve serious or life threatening conditions 
                    such as seizures. Another unique and exciting aspect of marijuana as 
                    a medicine is that each strain can have very different medical 
                    properties. A certain strain can help an insomniac find sleep, 
                    while another can help a user with chronic pain get energized 
                    and pain-free as they start their day. This range of medical 
                    relief all comes from a plant bred for thousands of years, as 
                    opposed to new drugs tested on a small group for a few years before 
                    hitting the market to be sold at a huge markup. You can learn more

                    <h3> user review</h3>
                    <p>Dr. MaryJane user Jessica has this to say about using our app:<br>
                        " Before being diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS)
                         I had never considered using medical marijuana, and didn't 
                         know how it could help with my symptoms. My EDS gives me quite 
                         a few unpleasant symptoms, such as nausea, difficulty eating, 
                         headaches, and most debilitating, extreme pain in my joints 
                         and on the surface of my skin. I desperately searched for 
                         medicines to help alleviate these symptoms as they severely 
                         interfered with my ability to work and even just see my 
                         friends and family. I tried various expensive medicines 
                         to treat these, and ultimately my doctor felt that medical 
                         marijuana would give me the best relief with the least 
                         side-effects. I was apprehensive at first, especially when I 
                         searched the internet and saw just how many different strains 
                         there are! I am so glad that I found Dr. MaryJane, it helped 
                         me find strains that help with each of my different symptoms.
                          It is so easy to simply input which symptom or symptoms I am 
                          having a hard time with, and then I have a list of options 
                          that all work for me on the spot. At first, I just wanted 
                          treatment for my symptoms, but now that I have found strains 
                          that alleviate those I am able to find some that treat my 
                          pain and give me a boost of energy. So now I can have 
                          relief that helps me get going and then later wind down 
                          for the evening. I don't know how I could have navigated 
                          through so many hundreds of strains without Dr. MaryJane! 
                          It has given me a variety of strains that let me do what I 
                          want without worrying about my symptoms. It really has made 
                          my life so much better! "
